Messy play ideas - our top tips
Cover them up

You can buy plastic aprons or even an all in one wetsuit, maybe just dress them in one of Dad's old shirts (but do ask him first!).   If there is less of them on show then there is less of them to wash up afterwards and they can then easily take off their top layer when they do get bored of mess making.

Or let them go naked!

No clothes on, means no clothes dirty and that means your washing pile doesn't increase! They will probably end up filthy but they can extend their fun with a warm bubble bath to get them clean and cuddly again.

Play outside

You may end up with a multicoloured lawn or patio but the rain can wash that away easily.  It's easier to use large sheets of paper outside too to help them develop their gross motor skills.

Protect your surfaces

Put down plastic sheets or old towels to catch spills and protect your floors.  Cover work surfaces with old newspapers so any mess can easily be rolled up and thrown away at the end of the session.

Use the big sink

Let them pull up a chair to the kitchen sink and splash about in there.  It's much easy and safer than carrying a bowl full of water to the table for them to play with.
